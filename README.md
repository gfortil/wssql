Steps for building in Linux:

- Check out source hpcc-systems/wssql
- Run `git submodules --init --recursive` to pull all necessary sources
- Setup Antlr and Antlr3c - Downloads available from ANTLR's github page https://github.com/antlr/website-antlr3/tree/gh-pages/download
  - "antlr-${ANTLR_VER}-complete.jar" and "antlr-runtime-${ANTLR_VER}.jar" are required.
  - Build process looks for these files here: /usr/local/ANTLR/${ANTLR_VER} where ANTLR_VER = 3.4
  - "antlr-${ANTLR_VER}-complete.jar" is a build time dep
  - "antlr-runtime-${ANTLR_VER}.jar" is also a build time dep (extract its contents in /usr/local/ANTLR/${ANTLR_VER})
  - If building a distributable package, make sure to include ANTLR's license file: https://raw2.github.com/antlr/antlr4/master/LICENSE.txt in the ANTLR folder and abide by their license. 
- Create a build directory - preferably at the same level as the two source dirs "wssql and HPCC-Platform"
- cd to the build directory
- Create the CMAKE project
  - To create makefiles to build native release version for local machine, run: cmake ~/wssql
  - To create makefiles to build native debug version, run: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ~/wssql
- To build the makefiles just created above, run: make
- To create a build package, run: make package

If a user wishes to do a parallel build:
- Check out pre-req source hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform
  - check ~/wssql/platform-version-prereq.cmake for minimum version required
